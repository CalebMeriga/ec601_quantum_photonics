EC601 Quantum Photonics 
Wesley Coleman, Peiliang Du, Weichen Jiang, Caleb Meriga

Our group focus on researching the industry of quantum photonics. We explored the python quantum photonics simulator from Strawberry Fields Xanadu,
learned quantum photonics concepts, and researched the algorithms implemented in quantum photonics.
